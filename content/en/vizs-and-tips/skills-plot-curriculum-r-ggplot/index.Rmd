In this TypeThePipe tip we are bringing you a skills plot template using R and ggplot2. Maybe its a good idea to evolve this plot and add an unique skill plot to your CV. And it's only a few lines of R code!

You can see the code below :)

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
# library(plotly)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)

skills <- tribble(
    ~ Skill, ~ Hours, ~ Class,
    "AWS", 500, "BigData",
    "Python", 8000, "Language",
    "Spark", 4000, "BigData",
    "R", 9000, "Language",
    "Git", 2000, "Tools",
    "Jira", 2000, "Tools",
    "Forecasting", 5000, "Objetive",
    "Segmentation", 2000, "Objetive",
    "Computer Vision", 600, "Objetive",
    "SQL", 4500, "Language",

    "Shiny R", 1500, "Visualization",
    "Tableau", 1000, "Visualization",
    "Spotfire", 500, "Visualization"
) 
```


```{r, skills-plot, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# plotly(
ggplot(data=skills,aes(x=reorder(Skill,-desc(Hours)), y= Hours, fill=Class, label=paste0(Hours," h"))) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", colour="black") +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x=" ", y="Hours", fill=" ")  +
    theme_minimal() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlOrBr",direction = -1) +
    geom_label(show_guide  = F, aes(y=400))                  # Use show_guide despite the warning

```
