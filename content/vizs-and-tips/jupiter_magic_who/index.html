<p>A recurrent complain about Jupyter Notebooks between beginner users is the lack of information about the self-created environment variables. If you have this question, probably first of all you should be sure about the Jupyter Notebooks main purpose (totally different from IDEs like Spyder or Pycharm).</p>
<p>But in case a notebook is all what you need, you have few ways to display this information. The first and easiest one is to use the magic method <strong>%whos</strong>

<p>Two alternative ways are nbextension and Jupyter Lab variable inspector. You can find more information <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37718907/variable-explorer-in-jupyter-notebook">here</a></p>
